## My process

- I started by creating a basic card in plain HTML/CSS.
- Then added the QR code image in the card (Took me a little while to adjust the image to the card).
- Then added final touches with the background colors and fonts

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

    I learned how I can manage the style sheet and style different elements that are contained within each other

### Continued development

I'd like to master CSS styling and learn the best practise when it comes to styling an element in the website
